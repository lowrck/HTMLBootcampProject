    Steve Jobs was the co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc.
    He is widely considered a to be a brilliant businessman, as well as one of the greatest tech visionaries on our time.
    The story of his life is nothing short of fascinating. After dropping out of college, he started Apple with his friend Steve Wozniak in 1976 at the age of 21.
    The duo gained wealth and fame a year later for the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers.

    This was followed by the very successful Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI (graphical user interface).
    After being ousted of Apple in 1985, he went on to oversee the creation of two new comapnies: NeXT computer and Pixar.
    With the success of the movie Toy Story, Steve became a billionaire.
    In 1997, Steve returned to Apple. Bill Gates and Microsoft dominated the computer industry, and Apple was on the brink of extinction.
    Nonetheless, Steve was a fantastic salesman, and used his business acumen to slowly bring the company back to profitability.
